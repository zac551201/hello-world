just another repository

Hi humans!

On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Commits are pretty glorious, because a bunch of them together read like the history of your project.

Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Thanks to these messages, you and others can read through commits and understand what youâ€™ve done and why.

You should still be on the code view for your readme-edits branch, now make some changes!
